# Hilo
Can your heart still function if you lose? Play HiLo to find out! The rules are simple. The dealer draws a new card. You guess if the next one will be higher or lower. Earn 100 points if you're right. Lose 75 if you're wrong. End the game at any time or just keep playing. Watch out though. Lose all your points and the game is ended for you!

## Getting Started
